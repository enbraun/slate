Search Project API allows filtering the results returned in various ways. This enables a great power to find out what is needed. eRS Cloud API also allows filtering on custom defined fields with multiple operators and conditions to cover up complex scenarios for searching.

A filter condition consists of three components which are **_field_**, **_operator_** and **_value_**. For example fetching only those projects having project type id 1, could be achieved by adding project_type_id:eq=1 to your query.  If operator is not supplied, it takes default operator for field. <a href="#filters" class="api-ref">Read more</a>

Below is a list of available fields, which allow filtering projects:

> Example Request For Filter By Passing Multiple Rules In JSON Format

```shell

"https://app.eresourcescheduler.cloud/rest/v1/projects/search" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer B8x5Vj1O65r6wnoV" \

      "project_type_id:eq": 1, 
      "project_start_date:gt": "2015-04-02" 
    }'
```

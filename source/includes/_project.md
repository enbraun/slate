<span style="color:#b93d6a">`Project`</span> object contains all the information about a project. Project is used as an activity for resources to be scheduled for. The API allows you to list, search, create, delete, and update project.

<span class="optional"><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></span>

Name      |  Description
 ---:     |    :---- 
**id** <br>`integer` |  eRS Cloud generated unique identifier for the project object.
**title** <br>`string` | Represents title or name of the project. This may be up to 255 characters.
**type** <br>`object` | Describes the type of project. This is one of the project type objects which an admin user creates using eRS Cloud Application.
**email** <br>`string` | An optional email address of project object.
**project_start_date** <br>`string` |  Date on which project is considered started.
**end_date** <br>`string` | Date on which project is considered ended / completed.
**image** <br>`string` | String value representing URL of image file of project.
**tags** <br>`array of strings` | Tags are the list of strings (labels) attached to this project object which could be used for the purpose of filtering, identification or other information.

Search Project API allows filtering the results returned in various ways. This enables a great power to find out what is needed. eRS Cloud API also allows filtering on custom defined fields with multiple operators and conditions to cover up complex scenarios for searching.

A filter condition consists of three components which are **_field_**, **_operator_** and **_value_**. For example fetching only those projects having project type id 1, could be achieved by adding project_type_id:eq=1 to your query.  If operator is not supplied, it takes default operator for field. <a href="#filters" class="api-ref">Read more</a>

Below is a list of available fields, which allow filtering projects:

## Delete a project

 Permanently deletes requested project. It cannot be undone. By default, this operation will fail if a project has any booking, timesheet or rate associated with it. To override this, forceful deletion can be used which will delete all bookings, timesheets and rates and then, ultimately deletes the project object.

> **`DELETE /v1/projects/{ID}`**


> Example Request
 
```shell
curl -v -X DELETE \
"https://app.eresourcescheduler.cloud/rest/v1/projects/1" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer B8x5Vj1O65r6wnoV"
```

> Example Request For Forcefull Delete 
 
```shell
curl -v -X DELETE \
"https://app.eresourcescheduler.cloud/rest/v1/projects/1?\
force_delete_bookings=true&force_delete_rates=true&\
force_delete_timesheet_entry=true" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer B8x5Vj1O65r6wnoV"

| ---:        |    :----   
**200** <br><span class = "success">`OK`</span> |This status code indicates that the operation was successful and project deleted successfully.
**409** <br> <span class = "error">`Conflict`</span> |Conflict indicates that the project can not be deleted as there are bookings, timesheets or rates associated with this project. If you wish to delete it any way you must use force delete option by passing `true` for parameter `force_delete_bookings`, `force_delete_timesheet_entry` and `force_delete_rates` which will delete all associated bookings, timesheets and rates corresponding to the project. This operation deletes all bookings, timesheets and rates of requested project and project itself (shown in example request).
**403** <br> <span class = "error">`Forbidden`</span> | Authorization failed due to insufficient permissions. This occurs when user does not have enough access rights to perform this action. Access for each user can be controlled by an Administrator using eRS Cloud Application.

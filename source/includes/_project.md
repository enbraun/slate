<span style="color:#b93d6a">`Project`</span> object contains all the information about a project. Project is used as an activity for resources to be scheduled for. The API allows you to list, search, create, delete, and update project.

<span class="optional"><b>ATTRIBUTES</b></span>

Name      |  Description
 ---:     |    :---- 
**id** <br>`integer` |  eRS Cloud generated unique identifier for the project object.
**title** <br>`string` | Represents title or name of the project. It can be up to 255 characters.
**type** <br>`object` | Describes the type of project. This is one of the project type objects which an Administrator user creates using eRS Cloud Application.
**email** <br>`string` | An optional email address of project object.
**project_start_date** <br>`string` |  Date on which project is considered started.
**end_date** <br>`string` | Date on which project is considered ended / completed.
**image** <br>`string` | String value representing URL of image file of project.
**tags** <br>`array of strings` | Tags are the list of strings (labels) attached to this project object which could be used for the purpose of filtering, identification or other information.
**timezone** <br>`integer` | Defines and categorize projects based on their location. This field is only available when scheduling plus module is on.
**project_calender** <br>`integer` | ID of the Calendar object, which should be assigned to the project. Depending upon requirements, different calendars can be applied to different projects. If the calendar is omitted, then the default calendar (as defined in the Administrator calendar settings) will be applied to this project.This field is only available when scheduling plus module is on.
**is_archive** <br>`boolean` | Boolean value representing whether this project is archived or not.
**created_on** <br>`string` | Timestamp at which this project object was created.

**modified_by** <br>`object` | Object representing most recent user who modified this project object.
**udf_\*** | Custom user-defined fields used to capture additional information of project. User defined field can be of multiple types. Custom fields are very useful to configure project objects to best fit requirements.  In given example response, all keys starting with prefix `udf_` are user defined custom fields. <a href="#user-defined-fields" class="api-ref">Learn more</a>

Search Project API allows filtering the results returned in various ways. This enables a great power to find out what is needed. eRS Cloud API also allows filtering on custom defined fields with multiple operators and conditions to cover up complex scenarios for searching.

A filter condition consists of three components which are **_field_**, **_operator_** and **_value_**. For example fetching only those projects having `project_type_id` 1, could be achieved by adding `"project_type_id:eq":1 ` to your query.  If operator is not supplied, it takes default operator for field. <a href="#filters" class="api-ref">Read more</a>

Below is a list of available fields, which allow filtering projects:

## Update a Project

Updates specified project by setting the values of the parameters passed. Any parameters which are not provided remains unchanged. To unset existing value for a parameter, just pass an empty value i.e. `null`.

This request accepts mostly the same arguments as `Create Project` API, except user can never update `project_type_id` of any project.

## Delete a Project

 Permanently deletes requested project. It cannot be undone. By default, this operation will fail if a project has any bookings, timesheets or rates associated with it. To override this, forceful deletion can be used which will delete all bookings, timesheets and rates and then, ultimately deletes the project object.

> **`DELETE /v1/projects/{ID}`**

```shell
curl -v -X DELETE \
"https://app.eresourcescheduler.cloud/rest/v1/projects/1" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer B8x5Vj1O65r6wnoV"

Exception is nothing but time duration that is different from a general schedule. eRS provides you the feature to add an exception to a project.

Let's say there's a project with a calendar that doesn't have Sunday as a working day. But for some reason, work has to be done on the project on Sunday. In this case, it's a working exception. So, in such a situation, exceptions come in handy.


eRS Cloud provides you two types of exceptions: 
    <ol><li>Working Exception : <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Working Exception is added on a non-working day. </p></li> <li>Non-working Exception : <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Non-working Exception is added on a working day. </p></li></ol>

_**Note**: Working Exception can be added without timings._

 **is_working_exception**  <br><span class="required">`boolean`</span>|Is working exception describes whether exception is a working exception or non working exception. True value means that exception is working exception and false value means that exception is non working exception.
